Framework Types
1. TDD 
Test Driven Development

Design Patterns
1. SingleTon
2. POM: Page Object Model
--means one class for every page
--the test class will contain all the relevant test cases for that page
--the code class will contain the attributes and actions for that page

2. WebdriverManager
3. Apache POI

Rules:
1. Follow the OOPs concept
2. No Hard Coding
3. Different pages and re usable code

Folder Structure:
src/main/java >> this will contain the main java code
src/main/test >> this will contain the test cases

src/main/resources >> this will contain the resource file for code
src/test/resources >> this will contain the relevant test data or files

Test Case:
1. What am i Testing
2. What is the expected output and what is the test data
3. Compare the actual OP with expected OP
4. It will not know how to test or what actions needs to be done
